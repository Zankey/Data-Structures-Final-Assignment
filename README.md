# School-Assign-2
AVL tree (allowing duplicates):
This was the final assignment in my data structures class.
We were to implement a balanced tree algorithm and modify its basic funtionality.

This was a modification of an AVL tree to allow for duplicate nodes.
My design took all duplicates and placed them behind its original node as if it were a three dimensional tree. 

The assignment called for lazy deletion, so when removing a node, it only becomes logically deleted.

The Result Interface and the UnderflowException class are required.

This was structured around Weiss code yet most is original. I have commented //*Weiss* for the few pieces that were taken from the Weiss Data structures Textbook and not original work.
